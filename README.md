# -Password-Strength-Checker
The Password Strength Checker is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that evaluates the strength of a user's password based on various criteria like length, use of special characters, numbers, and mixed cases. The program helps users create more secure passwords by categorizing them as "weak," "moderate," or "strong."
